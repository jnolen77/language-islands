# 🌍 AI Language Island Sentence Creator

The **AI Language Island Sentence Creator** is a full-stack web application that helps users learn a foreign language (such as German) by generating thematic "language islands" — personalized clusters of useful vocabulary and sentences for specific contexts like restaurants, hotels, train stations, and more.

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project uses an AI backend to generate sentences based on user input and chosen topics. It supports Text-to-Speech playback and allows users to save and manage their own language islands. It's built as a **monorepo** with separate frontend and backend folders.
